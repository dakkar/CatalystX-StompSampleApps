CatalystX::StompSampleApps - some sample STOMP consumer apps with
bells & whistles

Commands for the first application:

   * have a STOMP broker (activemq, for example) running on
     localhost:61613, or edit the app1.conf file appropriately
   * run script/app1.pl for the consumer
   * run script/test_app1.pl for the producer
   * the consumer log should process a few messages and then log "GOT IT"

   You can also run app1 without a broker, using the filesystem
   instead. This is intended to facilitate automated integration
   testing:

   * run script/app1-nonetwork.pl for the consumer
   * run script/test_app1-nonetwork.pl for the producer
   * the consumer log should process a few messages and then log "GOT IT"

   Look at app1-nonetwork.pl and app1-nonet.conf to see how it's done

Commands for the second application:

   * run script/app2_deploy.pl to create the database (a SQLite db on
     /tmp/events.db, edit app2.conf to change this)
   * have a STOMP broker (activemq, for example) running on
     localhost:61613, or edit the app2.conf file appropriately
   * run script/app2.pl for the consumer
   * run script/test_app2_sendevent.pl, you can pass a string as the
     only command line param, that will be sent as the value of the
     message
   * run script/test_app2_dump.pl, the consumer should log the text of
     all the messages it received up to that point
   * run "script/test_app2_dump.pl /queue/log" (or whatever
     destination name you want) to have the consumer dump the texts
     inside a single message to that destination
